## Support Vector Machine with Stochastic Gradient Descent

This is a personal project focused on detecting anomalies in the Forex market.

The script is made in PySpark and with the use of the pyspark.mllib library I trained a SVM with the SGD algorithm.
The model takes as input the range of the body as well as the wicks of the 15 minutes candles.
