## Algorithmic Trading

This is a personal project to find strategies to "beat the market".

You can find several backtesting strategies, the first one uses the Envelopes strategy and the second one is a Moving Average reversion strategy.

The Envelope strategy is the only one profitable so far. Below. you can see a graph of the results:
